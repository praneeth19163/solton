                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>In our college we face different problems in our day to day life like the projectors not working in the class rooms, faculty being absent, faulty lab apparatus and many more. We might not solve all these problems. These problems are not only faced by students but also by the faculty. All these queries might not be brought to the sight of the management. </p>

                <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
                <p>We propose a solution for the above problem statement as SOLTON. Solton is a website where we can register all our day to day college problems and get the solutions as soon as possible without any delay. All the problems in the above statement will be solved irrespective of the department.</p>
